Anamnesis is a standalone tool that is used to modify certain clientside-only values and allow the user a greater degree of flexibility for making creative and interesting screenshots. In short, this tool allows its users to temporarily change their race, gender, looks, equipment, etc. in game without actually making any changes visible to other players. This tool also allows users to create their own poses. 

Anamnesis is the successor to [Concept Matrix (CMTool)](https://github.com/imchillin/CMTool).

This project is a work in progress and is not currently in a state to replace CMTool. Please do not download the code expecting it to work like CMTool. Check the [Releases](https://github.com/imchillin/Anamnesis/releases) page for official releases.
