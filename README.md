# Anamnesis
![Anamnesis](Anamnesis/Assets/Concept%20Matrix.png "Anamnesis")

Anamnesis is a standalone tool that is used to modify certain clientside-only values and allow the user a greater degree of flexibility for making creative and interesting screenshots. In short, this tool allows its users to temporarily change their race, gender, looks, equipment, etc. in game without actually making any changes visible to other players. This tool also allows users to create their own poses. 

Anamnesis is the successor to [Concept Matrix (CMTool)](https://github.com/imchillin/CMTool).

This project is a work in progress and is not currently in a state to replace CMTool. Please do not download the code expecting it to work like CMTool. Check the [Releases](https://github.com/imchillin/Anamnesis/releases) page for official releases. 

We actively encourage people to contribute to the project with their forks to improve the tool overall. With this said, we are **not** supporting builds done via forks and, if you've received a release of the tool from any repo that isn't [imchillin/Anamnesis](https://github.com/imchillin/Anamnesis), you are encouraged to bring the issue up with the person who packaged the build, as it will inevitably contain code we're unfamiliar with.

(It takes a few seconds to do a pull request, just be cool.)

**We do NOT support the 'Unofficial' French release by Luna664.** Do not ask for assistance with that repo.
