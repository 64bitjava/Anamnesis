![CM3](ConceptMatrix3/Assets/Concept%20Matrix.png "CM3")

Concept Matrix is a standalone tool that is used to modify certain client side only values and allow them a greater degree of flexibility for making creative and interesting screenshots. In short, this tool allows its users to temporarily change their race, gender, looks, equipment, etc in game without actually making any changes visible to other players. This tool also allows users to create their own poses.
