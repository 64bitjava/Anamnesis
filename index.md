### A quick note

Anamnesis is still in beta, and bugs are to be expected. It's far from a completed project, so please be on the lookout and [let us know about any issues or oddities you find](https://github.com/imchillin/Anamnesis/issues)!

Additionally, Anamnesis currently only works with the International (JP/NA/EU) version of the game. We're sorry, KR and CN client users! We'll have this updated for you in the near future!

[Our wiki](https://github.com/imchillin/Anamnesis/wiki) is an ever-growing compendium of information on how to use the tool, as well as explanations of its various functions. We add to this as new features are implemented in the tool, as well!
